Import Product
--------------
\ **Description**\ 
 \ *Import Products*\ 
\ **Help**\ 
 \ *Before importing, Adempiere checks the Unit of Measure (default if not set), the Product Category (default if not set), the Business Partner, the Currency (defaults to accounting currency if not set), the Product Type (only Items and Services), the uniqueness of UPC, Key and uniqueness and existence of the Vendor Product No.
Adempiere tries to map to existing products, if the UPC, the Key and the Vendor Product No matches (in this sequence). If the imported record could be matched, product field values will only be overwritten, if the corresponding  Import field is explicitly defined.  Example: the Product Category will only be overwritten if explicitly set in the Import.*\ 

.. note::
    The Single Row Layout checkbox indicates if the default display type for this window is a single row as opposed to multi row.
If not selected, the user cannot create a new Record.  This is automatically disabled, if the Tab is Read Only.
