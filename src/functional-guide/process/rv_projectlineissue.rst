Project Margin (Work Order)
===========================

Work Order Project Lines (planned revenue) vs. Project Issues (costs)

Help
====
The Project Margin Report for Work Orders compares the Project lines (planned revenue) against the Project issues (actual effort and costs). The margin amount is calculated by subtracting the costs (issue) from the revenue (line).
The costs are in the currency of the Accounting Schema - the lines are in the currency of the price list of the project.
