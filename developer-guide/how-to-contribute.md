## **How do I format my contribution?**

Your contribution to ADempiere community is very important for us, for contribute to ADempiere community you must follow:

*   Create a ADempiere fork.
*   Patches need 'commit messages', which is the human-friendly documentation explaining what the change is and why it's necessary (When you send it, don't add angry commentary, as that will get your patch ignored. It might also get you silently blacklisted).
*   Changes have some technical requirements. There is a ADempiere coding style, and there are licensing requirements you need to comply with.
*   Show a step by step of bug or new functionality.
*   Take a moment for it and put images for show more information about issue.

## **How do I send my contribution?**

Use [git request-pull](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-request-pull), which will ensure that your patches are formatted in the standard manner. In order to use git request-pull, you'll need a fork from ADempiere.

For more information about using git request-pull, look at the [Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-request-pull) or type git help request-pull. There are a number of useful guides and tutorials about git request-pull that can be found on the internet.


## **I sent my pull request - now what?**

You should wait.

You can check if your pull request is assigned to contributors. If you not have a reply or comment on pull request , so be patient. ADempiere developers are generally very busy people, so it may take a few weeks before your patch is looked at.

## **How to test a existing pull request?**

Is very easy, just need git for your test:
 - Clone ADempiere repository
 <pre>git clone</pre>
 - Go to adempiere folder and get with fetch 
<pre>git fetch origin pull/pull-request-number/head:local-branch-name</pre>
 - switch to fetched branch
